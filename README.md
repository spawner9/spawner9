- 👋 Hi, I’m @spawner9
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of deep learning and reinforcement learning in medical image processing and nonlinear inverse problems, and also  GPU and autograd software design for better comptutation performance.  
- 🌱 I’m currently reading a mathematical PhD in Shanghai Jiaotong University in China.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some engineering projects using deep learning to solve real-world problems and try to develop more DL techiques based on mathematical foundations.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here is my personal school email address: spawner@sjtu.edu.cn
